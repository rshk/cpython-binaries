Unofficial CPython builds
#########################

Misc CPython interpreters I built and I needed a handy place to keep into :)

Tarballs are named using the following schema:

```
<interpreter-type>-<version>-<distro-codename>-<arch>.tar.bz2
```

and are meant to be unpacked in the ``/`` (usually, interpreters have been built
with ``--prefix=/opt/{name}-{major}.{minor}``).
